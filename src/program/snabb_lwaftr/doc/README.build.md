# How to build snabb-lwaftr

## Fetch the sources

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Igalia/snabbswitch.git
```

## Check out the lwaftr development branch:

```bash
$ cd snabbswitch && git checkout lwaftr_nutmeg
```

## Build

```bash
$ make
```

Note that this requires internet access to fetch the submodules.

This is all that is needed to build snabb-lwaftr.
See [README.first.md](README.first.md) for instructions on how to use it.
