Usage: snabb ps [OPTION]...
Print a list of running Snabb instances.

Available options:
  -h, --help                 Display this message.
  -p, --PID                  Display processes by their PID instead of name.

The default output format is one identifier by line. If the --p or --pid flag is
used then the it will ignore any name defined and list just the PID.  More
options can be added in the future.

The identifier is either the name (preferentially) or, if one is not defined,
the PID of the process is used.
