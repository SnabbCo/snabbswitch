snabbnfv traffic [OPTIONS] <pci-address> <config-file> <socket-path>

  -B NPACKETS, --benchmark NPACKETS
                             Benchmark processing NPACKETS.

Process traffic between Neutron ports and a physical NIC.

In benchmark mode, measure the throughput for the first <npackets> and
then report and terminate.

<config-file> lists all of the virtual machine ports. The file is in
Lua source format and returns an array of ports:

    return { <port-1>, ..., <port-n> }

Each port is defined by a range of properties which correspond to the
configuration parameters of the underlying apps (Intel10G, VhostUser,
PacketFilter, RateLimiter, nd_light and SimpleKeyedTunnel):

    port := { port_id        = <id>,          -- A unique string
	      mac_address    = <mac-address>, -- As for Intel10G
	      vlan           = <vlan-id>,     -- ..
	      ingress_filter = <rules>,       -- As for PacketFilter
	      egress_filter  = <rules>,       -- ..
	      tunnel         = <tunnel-conf>,
	      rx_police_gbps = <n>,           -- Allowed input rate in Gbps
	      tx_police_gbps = <n> }          -- Allowed output rate in Gbps

The tunnel section deviates a little from SimpleKeyedTunnel's
terminology:

    tunnel := { type          = "L2TPv3",     -- The only type (for now)
		local_cookie  = <cookie>,     -- As for SimpleKeyedTunnel
		remote_cookie = <cookie>,     -- ..
		next_hop      = <ip-address>, -- Gateway IP
		local_ip      = <ip-address>, -- ~ `local_address'
		remote_ip     = <ip-address>, -- ~ `remote_address'
		session       = <32bit-int>   -- ~ `session_id' }
