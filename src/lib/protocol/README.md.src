### Protocol Header (lib.protocol.header)

The `lib.protocol.header` contains the base class from which the supported
protocol classes are derived. It defines generic methods on all protocol
subclasses.

— Method **header:new_from_mem** *memory*, *length*

Creates and returns a header object by "overlaying" the respective header
structure over *length* bytes of *memory*.

— Method **header:header**

Returns the raw header as a *cdata* object.

— Method **header:sizeof**

Returns the byte size of header.

— Method **header:eq** *header*

Generic equality predicate. Returns `true` if *header* is equal to self
and `false` otherwise.

— Method **header:copy** *destination*, *relocate*

Copies the header to *destination*. The caller must ensure that there is
enough space at *destination*. If *relocate* is a true value,
*destination* is promoted to be the active storage for the header.

— Method **header:clone**

Returns a copy of the header object.

— Method **header:upper_layer**

Returns the protocol class that can handle the "upper layer protocol" or
`nil` if the protocol is not supported or the protocol has no upper
layer.

For instance, on an Ethernet header object this method might return a
IPv4 or IPv6 header class.

### Ethernet (lib.protocol.ethernet)

These upper layer protocols implement the headers necessary to perform
"Neighbor Discovery".

for the type.

— Method **icmp:type** *type*

instance fields (see `new`) of an ICMP header. If no argument is given
the current value is returned.

— Method **icmp:checksum** *payload*, *length*, *ipv6*

#### Neighbor Discovery Options (lib.protocol.icmp.nd.header)

Both Neighbor Solicitation and Advertisement (`lib.protocol.icmp.nd.ns`
and `lib.protocol.icmp.nd.na`) headers implement an `options` method for
parsing *TLV Options* contained in the their payloads.

Example:

```

— Method **nd:options** *payload*, *length*

#### TLV Option (lib.protocol.icmp.nd.options.tlv)

only includes `lladdr` instances.

#### Link-Layer Address Option (lib.protocol.icmp.nd.options.lladdr)

field is returned.


### Datagram (lib.protocol.datagram)

The `lib.protocol.datagram` module provides basic mechanisms for parsing,
building and manipulating a hierarchy of protocol headers and associated
payload contained in a data packet.  In particular, it supports:

* Parsing and in-place manipulation of protocol headers in a received
  packet
* In-place decapsulation by removing leading protocol headers
* Adding headers to an existing packet
* Creation of a new packet

It mediates between packets as defined in `core.packet` and *protocol
classes* which are defined as classes derived from the protocol header
base class in the `lib.protocol.header` module.

The contents of a datagram instance are logically divided into three
areas: The payload, parsed headers and synthetic headers. The datagram
payload is a sequence of bytes either inherited from the packet given to
`datagram:new` or appended using `datagram:payload`. The headers in the
payload can be parsed using `datagram:parse_match`, which will shrink the
payload by the header. Finally, synthetic headers can be prepended to the
datagram using `datagram:push`.  To get the whole datagram as a packet
use `datagram:packet`.

**Important Note:** The datagram class only operates on the first buffer
of a packet. If a packet can not be coalesced to a single buffer
the additional buffers will be ignored by `lib.protocol.datagram`.

    DIAGRAM: Datagram

    +------------------+

— Method **datagram:new** *packet*, *protocol*, *options*

Creates a datagram for *packet* or from scratch if *packet* is `nil`.
*Protocol* will be used by `parse_match` to parse the packet payload. If
*protocol* is not `nil` it is set as the initial upper layer
protocol. *Options* may be a table with the following keys:

* `coalesce` - If set to `true`, *packet* will be coalesced.

— Method **datagram:reuse** *packet*, *protocol*, *options*

Recycling version of `datagram:new`. Reuses the instance to create a
datagram.

— Method **datagram:push** *header*, *relocate*

Pushes *header* to the front of the datagram. By default *header* is
copied to the datagram.  If *relocate* is a true value, *header* is
relocated to the datagram instead.  E.g. header and datagram will share
the same buffer so that the datagram will reflect future changes to the
header. Note that in case of *relocate* being true, the caller must
ensure the *header* object to be discarded when the datagram is released.

— Method **datagram:parse_match** *protocol*, *check*

Attempts to parse the next header in the datagram, thereby removing it
from the payload. Returns a header instance of class *protocol* on
success. If *protocol* is `nil` the current upper layer protocol as set
by `datagram:new` or previous calls to `parse_match` is used.

If neither *protocol* nor the upper layer protocol is set or the
constructor of the protocol class returns `nil`, the parsing operation
has failed and `parse_match` returns `nil`.  The datagram remains
unchanged.

If the protocol class instance has been created successfully, it is
passed as single argument to the anonymous function *check*.

If *check* returns a false value, the parsing has failed and
`parse_match` returns `nil`.  The packet remains unchanged.

If *check* is not supplied or if it returned a true value, the parsing
has succeeded and the current upper layer protocol of the datagram is set
to the value returned by `header:upper_layer`.

Note that `parse_match` can only parse the first buffer of the underlying
packet.

— Method **datagram:parse** *protocols_and_checks*

A wrapper around `parse_match` that allows parsing of a sequence of
headers with a single method call.

If *protocols_and_checks* is a sequence of protocol class and check
function pairs, `parse_match` is called for each pair. Returns the header
object of the last header parsed or `nil` if any of the calls to
`parse_match` return `nil`.

If called with a `nil` argument, this method is equivalent to
`parse_match` called without arguments.

— Method **datagram:parse_n** *n*

A wrapper around `parse_match` that parses the next *n* protocol headers
using the current upper layer protocol and subsequent values of
`header:upper_layer`. It returns the last header object or `nil` if less
than *n* headers could be parsed successfully.

— Method **datagram:unparse** *n*

Undoes the last *n* calls to `parse_match` on the datagram. E.g. prepends
*n* parsed headers back to the payload. The sequence of parsed headers
can be obtained by calling `stack`.

— Method **datagram:pop** *n*

Removes the leading *n* parsed headers from the datagram. Note that
headers added via `push` can not be removed using `pop`. The caller has
to ensure that the datagram contains at least *n* headers that were
parsed using `parse_match`.  The sequence of parsed headers can be
obtained by calling `stack`.

For instance let *d* be an datagram with an Ethernet header followed by
an IPv6 header. Assuming we have parsed both headers using
`d:parse_n(2)`, we could call `d:pop(1)` to decapsulate the IPv6 packet
from its Ethernet header.

— Method **datagram:pop_raw** *length*, *ulp*

Remove *length* bytes from the beginning of the datagram. If *ulp* is
given it is set as the current upper layer protocol.

— Method **datagram:stack**

Returns the parsed header objects as a sequence.

— Method **datagram:packet**

Returns a packet (see `core.packet`) containing the datagram (including
pushed headers).

— Method **datagram:payload** *pointer*, *length*

Combined payload accessor and setter method. Returns a pointer to the
datagram payload, its byte size and the `packet.iovec` index of the next
buffer if the payload is incomplete or `nil`.

The payload is incomplete if the underlying packet consists of more than
one buffer. The caller has to access the remainder of the payload,
e.g. any additional packet buffers, by his own.

If *pointer* and *length* are supplied then *length* bytes starting from
*pointer* are appended to the datagram's payload. If there is not enough
free space in the buffer to append *length* bytes or if the payload is
incomplete an error will be raised.
