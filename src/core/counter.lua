-- counter.lua - Count discrete events for diagnostic purposes
-- 
-- This module provides a thin layer for representing 64-bit counters
-- as shared memory objects.
--
-- Counters let you efficiently count discrete events (packet drops,
-- etc) and are accessible as shared memory from other processes such
-- as monitoring tools. Counters hold 64-bit unsigned integers.
-- 
-- Use counters to make troubleshooting easier. For example, if there
-- are several reasons that an app could drop a packet then you can
-- use counters to keep track of why this is actually happening.
--
-- You can access the counters using this module, or the raw core.shm
-- module, or even directly on disk. Each counter is an 8-byte ramdisk
-- file that contains the 64-bit value in native host endian.
--
-- For example, you can read a counter on the command line with od(1):
-- 
--     # od -A none -t u8 /var/run/snabb/15347/counter/a
--     43

local shm = require("core.shm")
local ffi = require("ffi")
require("core.counter_h")

local counter_t = ffi.typeof("struct counter")

-- Double buffering:
-- For each counter we have a private copy to update directly and then
-- a public copy in shared memory that we periodically publish to.
--
-- This is important for a subtle performance reason: the shared
-- memory counters all have page-aligned addresses (thanks to mmap)
-- and accessing many of them can lead to expensive cache misses (due
-- to set-associative CPU cache). See SnabbCo/snabbswitch#558.
