--- ### Chunks
---
--- Physical memory is allocated from the operating system in large
--- "chunks" which are then sliced up to serve individual
--- variable-size allocations. There is always one "current chunk"
--- that memory is allocated from. If the current chunk is not large
--- enough for a given allocation then it is replaced by a fresh HugeTLB page.

-- Current chunk: virtual address, physical address, total size
local chunk_ptr, chunk_phy, chunk_size

--- The `dma_regions` table keeps a list of every chunk that has been allocated. This is effectively a list of all memory that our process may want to use for DMA.
---
--- This is useful information. For example, our Vhost_net client has
--- to declare this memory to the Linux kernel for direct access.

dma_regions = {}

--- Install a new chunk of memory at a specific physical memory
--- address. This is an alternative to dynamically allocating HugeTLB
--- pages. You could reserve a block of physical memory by booting
--- Linux with:
---
---         linux memmap=16M$0x10000000
---
--- and then huge that reserved memory with this call:
---
---         memory.install(0x10000000, 16*1024*1024)
function install (physical, size)
   local ptr = C.map_physical_ram(physical, physical+size, true)
   if ptr == nil then error("Error installing RAM at 0x"..bit.tohex(physical)) end
   add_chunk(ffi.cast("char*",ptr), physical, size)
end

--- Install a new chunk from a fresh dynamically allocated HugeTLB page.
function install_huge_page ()
   local page = allocate_huge_page()
   if page == nil then error("Failed to allocate HugeTLB page for DMA.") end
   add_chunk(ffi.cast("char*",page), map(page), huge_page_size)
end

--- Add a new chunk of memory for the next DMA allocations.
function add_chunk (ptr, physical, size)
   local address = tonumber(ffi.cast("uint64_t", ptr))
   dma_regions[#dma_regions + 1] = {address = address, size = size}
   chunk_ptr, chunk_phy, chunk_size = ptr, physical, size
end

--- DMA is allocated from the current chunk, which is replaced once it
--- becomes too small.

-- Allocate physically contiguous memory that is suitable for DMA.
-- Returns three values when successful:
--   Virtual memory address as a void* pointer for use within Lua (or nil).
--   Physical memory address as a uint64_t for passing to hardware.
--   Actual number of bytes allocated, which can be different than requested.
-- Returns nil on failure.

--- Allocate `size` bytes of memory suitable for DMA. Return three
--- values on success:
---
--- 1. `char*` pointer to the memory in our address space.
--- 2. `uint64_t` physical address.
--- 3. Actual number of bytes allocated, which may be more than requested.
---
--- XXX: This line is to terminate the above list. We'll need to use
--- fenced codeblocks instead of relying on four space indentation to
--- signify the start of a block because the four space rule also
--- allows you to use multi block list items (even if there are blank
--- newlines in between!)
