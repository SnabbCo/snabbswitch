abcJIT: a JIT for Snabb Switch (descended from LuaJIT)

    abcJIT is a descendent of LuaJIT that is targeted at Snabb Switch. The
    development philosophy of "what would Mike do?" is replaced with "what
    would be best for Snabb Switch?".

    abcJIT is a response of sorts to Mike Pall's call for the community to
    take charge of the future development of LuaJIT:
    http://www.freelists.org/post/luajit/Looking-for-new-LuaJIT-maintainers

    abcJIT moves in a new direction:
    - Ruthlessly eliminate code that Snabb Switch does not use.
    - Helpfully write and review comments to explain the code.
    - Experimentally add features that make Snabb Switch easier to develop.

    abcJIT benefits Snabb Switch hackers:
    - Learn about JIT internals by making simple changes.
    - Optimize more effectively thanks to better community expertise.
    - Defend the self-sufficiency that is one of the core Snabb values.

    abcJIT benefits LuaJIT hackers:
    - Grow the pool of people with maintenance experience.
    - Explore design ideas in the post-"what would Mike do?"-era.
    - Cooperate with maintainers of other trees to share code and ideas.

    abcJIT exists only while it is beneficial to Snabb Switch. In all
    likelihood it will be merged into another more mainstream LuaJIT tree
    in the future. However, we would keep the valuable experience of
    having taken charge of the code we depend on, even if only for a while.

    The Snabb Switch community forked abcJIT from LuaJIT v2.1 in September 2015.
